- Read sections 1, 2, and 4 of [Data Types as Lattices](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ikfyrwkizooah3q/data_types_as_lattices.pdf?dl=1) Update: I obtained a better typeset version from Scott which is [here](./ScottDTL1976.pdf).
- Look up the definitions of
  * topological space,
  * open set,
  * a basis for a topological space,
  * and continuous functions between topological spaces.
  Give an instance of the above notions for the real number line.
- Prove that P(ω) is a topological space (as defined via open sets),
  using the basis given by Scott on page 584.
- Prove that a function is continuous (page 584)
  iff it is continuous in the topological sense, that is,
  if inverse images of open sets are open sets.
- Restate the proof of Theorem 2.2 in your own words.
  (The proof is in the Appendix, page 642.)
- Prove that (1), (2), and (3) on page 604 are retracts.
- Given the definition of int in equation (7) on page 606, prove that
    int(\bot) = \bot
    int(n) = n   (n is an integer)
    int(\top) = \top
- Work out the semantics of (λx.x+1)(2) using the semantics defined
  on page 613. Show your work.
