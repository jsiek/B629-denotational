- Read [Intersection Types and Lambda Models](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2006.01.004)
- Prove associativity of intersection with respect to the type
  preorder using the axioms in Fig. 1.
- Define an isomorphism (a function and its inverse) between Engeler's
  domain:
  D = ℤ + ℘f(D) × D
  and intersection types (taking ℂ to be {Ω} ∪ ℤ), using the rules (→-∩~),
  (η~), and (Ω-η). Define an ordering relation on Engeler's domain and
  show that this ordering is the inverse of subtyping, as in 
  Proposition 3 of [Revisiting Elementary Denotational Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03762).
- Use results from the paper [Intersection Types and Lambda Models](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2006.01.004) to show that the filter model
  for the intersetions type system En corresponding to Engeler's domain.
