- Read Nate Foster's [lecture notes](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6110/2011sp/lectures/lecture24.pdf) on the D∞ model of the λ-calculus.
  - I believe there is an error in the definition of down(f).
    Instead of d_0 = f(\bot) it should be d_0 = \bot.
  - Compute the meaning of λx.x, λx.λy.y, λx.λy.x, and (λx.x) (λx.x),
    but only giving the first three elements of the infinite tuple.
    You can use Nate's definitions of up and down, or alternatively
    use Scott's definitions which can be found in my notes
    (named apply and abstr).

- Read [An introduction to the category-theoretic solution of recursive domain equations](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2401150/8930814.pdf)
- TBD
