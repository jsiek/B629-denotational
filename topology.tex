\title{Notes on Topology}

\author{Jeremy G. Siek}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

We start by considering topological notions in the
familiar setting of the real numbers $\Reals$.

\begin{definition}[Continuous]
  A function $f : A \to \Reals$, with $A \subseteq \Reals$,
  is continuous at $c \in A$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$,
  there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
  \[
    |x - c| < \delta \land x \in A \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon
  \]
  A function $f$ is continuous on a set $B \subseteq A$ if it is
  continuous on every element in B.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
$f(x) = \sqrt x$ is continuous at all $c > 0$. 
For $0 \leq x$, we calculate
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sqrt-cont-1}
   |f(x) - f(c)| = |\sqrt x - \sqrt c| 
    = \left| \frac{x - c}{\sqrt x + \sqrt c} \right|
    \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt c} |x - c|
\end{equation}
Choose $\delta = \epsilon \sqrt c$. Assume $|x - c| < \epsilon \sqrt c$
and $x \in A$. We need to show that $|\sqrt x - \sqrt c| < \epsilon$.
From the assumption we have $\frac{1}{\sqrt c}|x - c| < \epsilon$,
and then by calculation \eqref{eq:sqrt-cont-1} we conclude.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\[
   \mathrm{sign}(x) = 
   \begin{cases}
     1 & \text{if } x > 0 \\
     0 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
     -1 & \text{if } x < 0 
   \end{cases}
\]
$\mathrm{sign}$ is not continuous at $0$. Consider $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$.
We have $|f(x)| = 1$ for any $x \neq 0$, no matter how close $x$ is to
$0$. And obviously, $|f(x)| = 1 \not < \frac{1}{2}$.
\end{example}


\begin{definition}[Open Interval]
  $I_r(x) = (x-r,x+r)$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Neighborhood]
  A set $U \subseteq \Reals$ is a neighborhood of $x \in \Reals$
  if there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $I_\delta(x) \subseteq U$.
  (Munkres instead defines a neighborhood of $x$ to be
   an open set containing $x$.)
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[N-Continuous]
  A function $f : A \to \Reals$, with $A \subseteq \Reals$,
  is n-continuous at $c \in A$ if for every neighborhood
  $V$ of $f(c)$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $c$
  such that
  \[
    x \in A \cap U \implies f(x) \in V
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Continuous and n-continuous are equivalent.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
   Intuitively, the reason that they are the same is that in the
   definition of continuity, we talk of all the $x$'s that are within
   a certain distance of $c$, which means we're talking about an open
   interval around $c$, and a neighborhood of $c$ is guaranteed to
   include such a open interval around $c$. (And similarly for an open
   interval around $f(c)$.)
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item (continuous $\implies$ n-continuous)
     Suppose $f$ is continuous at $c$.
     Let $V$ be a neighborhood of $f(c)$.
     By the definition of neighborhood there exists a $\epsilon > 0$ such that
     \begin{equation} \label{eq:ball-V-1}
     I_\epsilon(f(c)) \subseteq V
     \end{equation}
     Because $f : A \to \Reals$ is continuous at $c$, 
     there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
     \begin{equation} \label{eq:ed-cont-1}
     |x - c| < \delta \land x \in A \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon
     \end{equation}
     Choose $U=I_\delta(c)$. We need to show
     \[
     x \in A \cap U \implies f(x) \in V
     \]
     We assume $x \in A \cap U$. Then by \eqref{eq:ed-cont-1} we have
     $|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon$. So $f(x) \in I_\epsilon(f(c))$
     and then $f(x) \in V$ by \eqref{eq:ball-V-1}.
     Therefore $f$ is n-continuous.

   \item (n-continuous $\implies$ continuous) Suppose $f$ is
     n-continouous at $c$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Note that
     $I_\epsilon(f(c))$ is a neighborhood of $f(c)$. Then because $f$
     n-continuous there is a neighborhood $U$ of $c$ such that
     \begin{equation}\label{eq:xU-fx-Be}
       x \in A \cap U \implies f(x) \in I_\epsilon(f(c))
     \end{equation}
     Because $U$ is a neighborhood of $c$, there is a $\delta > 0$
     such that $I_\delta(c) \subseteq U$. We need to show that
     \[
     |x - c| < \delta \land x \in A \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon
     \]
     Assume $|x - c| < \delta$ and $x \in A$.
     We have $x \in U$, then by \eqref{eq:xU-fx-Be} obtain
     $f(x) \in I_\epsilon(f(c))$. From this we conclude that
     $|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon$. Therefore $f$ is continuous.

   \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}[Open Set]
  A set $A$ is open in $\Reals$ if for every $x \in A$ there exists
  $\delta > 0$ such that $I_\delta(x) \subseteq A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[O-Continuous]
  A function $f : A \to \Reals$ is o-continuous if for each
  open set $V \subseteq \Reals$, $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open subset of $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Continuous and o-continuous are equivalent.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}\ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item (continuous $\implies$ o-continuous)
  Let $V \subseteq \Reals$ be an open set.
  We need to show that $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set.
  Let $c$ be an arbitrary member of $f^{-1}(V)$. We need 
  to show that there exists an open interval around $c$
  that is contained by $f^{-1}(V)$.
%
  We have $f(c) \in V$. Then because $V$ is open, there exists
  $\epsilon > 0$ such that
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:i-fc-v}
  I_\epsilon(f(c)) \subseteq V
  \end{equation}
  Then by the
  continuity of $f$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:fx-iefc}
    x \in I_\delta(c) \implies  f(x) \in I_\epsilon(f(c))
  \end{equation}
  Now that we have an appropriate $\delta$, we need to show
  \[
  I_\delta(c) \subseteq f^{-1}(V) = \{ x \mid f(x) \in V \}
  \]
  Let $x$ be an arbitrary point in $I_\delta(c)$.  So by
  \eqref{eq:fx-iefc} we have $f(x) \in I_\epsilon(f(c))$.  Then by
  \eqref{eq:i-fc-v} we have $f(x) \in V$, therefore $x \in f^{-1}(V)$.


\item (o-continuous $\implies$ continuous) Let $\epsilon > 0$. Observe
  that $V=I_\epsilon(f(c))$ is an open set.  Then because $f$ is
  o-continuous, $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set.  We know $c \in
  f^{-1}(V)$, so there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:id-fv}
    I_\delta(c) \subseteq f^{-1}(V)
  \end{equation}
  We need to show that
  \[
  x \in I_\delta(c)  \implies f(x) \in V
  \]
  We assume $x \in I_\delta(c)$, so also $x \in f^{-1}(V)$
  by \eqref{eq:id-fv} and therefore $f(x) \in V$.

\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
